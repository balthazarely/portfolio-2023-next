These banners were designed for DISH and its affiliates, such as OnTech, SlingTV, and DISH Latino.\n\n Employing dynamic creative optimization (DCO), I ensured that the banners were flexible enough to undergo copy and image changes even after going live for testing purposes. While working at DISH/OneTen Creative, I spearheaded an initiative to update and optimize the banners, incorporating new ES6 features, HTML Canvas, and dynamic variables to GSAP animations. As a result, the average development time per banner set decreased from a week to just a day. ",
